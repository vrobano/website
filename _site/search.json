For the past three years, Virginia has organised the WiDS Montevideo conferences.\r\n            In 2013 Virginia won the first prize in a global competition organised by the Global Development Network (GDN) which had over 700+ submissions. Her research paper “The Part-time Premium Enigma: an Assessment of the Chilean Case” won the Medal on Research and Development / Social Protection. The award was received in Manila, Philippines.\r\n            Virginia has ample international experience, having worked and lived in the United States (worked at the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank), France (OECD and Sciences Po), Argentina (Universidad Torcuato di Tella, World Bank regional office) and Uruguay (Central Bank of Uruguay, Plan Ceibal). Her current location is London, UK and she continues to work with Plan Ceibal as an advisor on data and gender equality.\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Virginia Robano\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      website\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              Bio\r\n              Virginia Robano holds a PhD in Economics from George Washington University (USA).
